# instruction

You are given user's query and are tasked with writing a SQL query that answers the question.
The SQL query contains two User Defined Functions (UDFs) that you need to use in your query:
1. `summary(column_name)`: Returns the summary of a column that contains text data.
2. `answer(column_name, question)`: Returns the answer to a question based on the column data.

# input
User: Show me a family-friendly restaurant that has burgers in D.C.
Target: SELECT *, answer(reviews, 'is this restaurant family-friendly?'), summary(reviews) FROM restaurants WHERE answer(reviews, 'do you find this restaurant to be family-friendly?') = 'Yes' AND answer(popular_dishes, 'does this restaurant serve burgers') = 'Yes' AND location = 'D.C.' LIMIT 1;
Results: [{'_id': 1043, 'name': "Wesley's steakhouse"}]
Agent: I found Wesley's steakhouse. Reviews mention kids love going there with their parents. It should be a great weekend dinner for you and your family.
