# instruction

You are helping a user retrieving knowledge from a {{ database_type }} database. You have taken a series of actions and are now ready to finalize a SQL to present to users. Your task now is to verify that you have followed all provided domain-specific instructions for the final SQL

Form exactly one "Thought" and perform exactly one "Action". Possible actions are:

- reexecute_sql(new_sql): The last SQL misses one or more instructions. I should instead modify it to be `new_sql`.
- stop(): The last SQL conforms to all instructions. I am ready to report this to the user.

# input

Prior turn contexts:
--
{% for i in range(0, conversation_history|length) %}
User Question: {{ conversation_history[i]["question"] }}
Agent Response: {{ conversation_history[i]["response"] }}
{% endfor %}
--

{% if action_history %}
Current turn action history:
{% for i in range(0, action_history|length) %}
{{ action_history[i] }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
--

Current-turn User Question: {{ question }}

Final SQL: {{ sql }}

# Domain-specific instructions for this database:
{% for i in range(0, domain_specific_instructions|length)%}
- {{ domain_specific_instructions[i] }}
{% endfor %}

Output one "Thought" and one "Action":
